Professor Richard Zare in his lab. Whether it's the summer grass that tickles your feet or the red Bordeaux smacking on your palate,nearly every part of the world around you carries special chemical markers. These markers,called isotopes, can tell scientists where the molecules that compose a substance are from, where they traveled and what happened to them along the way. But doing these analyses has been complex and costly. Now,Stanford chemists have developed a newmethod to make isotopic analysis easier and less expensive.</td>
